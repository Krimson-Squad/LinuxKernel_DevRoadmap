Unlike other operating systems, such as **Microsoft**, which combine all components internally and release them as a single package, **Linux** takes a different approach. Various parts of Linux are developed by different organizations.

These components include the **kernel**, **shell utilities**, **X server**, **system environment**, **graphical programs**, and more. If you wish, you can access the code for each of these components and assemble them yourself. However, this process is not straightforward; it requires a significant amount of time and expertise, as all parts must be assembled correctly to function properly.

This flexibility allows users to create custom distributions tailored to their specific needs, showcasing the versatility and collaborative nature of the Linux ecosystem.
