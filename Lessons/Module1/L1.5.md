An **Operating System (OS)** serves as an interface between the **computer user** and the **computer hardware**. It is a software that performs essential tasks such as **file management**, **memory management**, **process management**, handling **input and output**, and controlling peripheral devices like **disk drives** and **printers**.

The OS enables applications to interact with a computer's hardware, and the core components of the operating system are encapsulated in a component known as the **kernel**.

The primary purposes of an Operating System are to facilitate communication between applications (software) and the computer's hardware and to manage the system's hardware and software resources effectively.

Some popular operating systems include:

- **Linux Operating System**
- **Windows Operating System**
- **VMS**
- **OS/400**
- **AIX**
- **z/OS**

Today, operating systems are found in nearly every device, including **mobile phones**, **personal computers**, **mainframe computers**, **automobiles**, **TVs**, and even **toys**.
