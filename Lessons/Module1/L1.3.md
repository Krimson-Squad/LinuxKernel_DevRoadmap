## Lesson 1.3: **Roles and Responsibilities of the Linux Kernel**

The **Linux Kernel** has four primary roles:

1. **Memory Management**: Keeps track of how much memory is used, what it’s used for, and where it’s stored.
2. **Process Management**: Determines which processes can utilize the **central processing unit (CPU)**, when they can do so, and for how long.
3. **Device Drivers**: Serves as a mediator and interpreter between the hardware and processes.
4. **System Calls and Security**: Manages requests for services from processes while ensuring system security.

When implemented properly, the kernel operates invisibly to the user within its designated area known as **kernel space**, where it allocates memory and monitors data storage. In contrast, the user interacts with applications, such as **web browsers** and **files**, which exist in **user space**. These applications communicate with the kernel via a **system call interface (SCI)**.

To illustrate, think of the kernel as a diligent **personal assistant** to a powerful executive (the hardware). Its responsibilities include relaying messages and requests (processes) from employees and the public (users) to the executive, remembering what is stored where (memory), and determining who has access to the executive at any given time and for how long.
