## Estimated time
20–40 minutes

## Objectives
- Show where to find kernel source files relevant to subsystems.
- Explain how to follow call chains using `cscope`/`ctags` or an IDE.
- Provide quick tips for reading kernel code effectively.

## Overview
Reading kernel source code can be daunting. This short guide points to tools and strategies to make it manageable.

## Tips
- Build ctags and use an editor that supports jump-to-definition.
- Start in high-level directories like `kernel/`, `mm/`, or `drivers/` depending on your interest.
- Follow the call chain: find the top-level API, then search its implementations.

## Exercises
- Pick a simple system call and trace its implementation from syscall table to handler.
- Use `ctags` to jump between a function declaration and its usage.
