The **Linux® kernel** is the central component of a **Linux Operating System (OS)** and serves as the core interface between a computer’s **hardware** and its **processes**. It manages communication between the two, ensuring that system resources are utilized as efficiently as possible.

The kernel gets its name from its role—like a _seed inside a hard shell_—because it resides at the core of the operating system and controls the primary functions of the hardware, whether that hardware is a **phone**, **laptop**, **server**, or any other type of computer.
