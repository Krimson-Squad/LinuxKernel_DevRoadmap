# L1.6 — How to contribute to this roadmap

Date: 2025-10-04

Author: Community Contributor (placeholder)

## Estimated time
15–30 minutes

## Objectives
- Show how to add or edit lessons in this repository.
- Provide a simple lesson template contributors can copy.
- Create a placeholder lesson so new contributors can see the format.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub (fork, branch, pull request).

## Overview
This is a short, contributor-oriented lesson that explains how to add lessons to the Linux Kernel Development Roadmap repository. It's intentionally short so new contributors can quickly add or modify content.

## Steps to contribute (brief)
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your lesson: `git checkout -b add-lesson-module1-l1-6`.
3. Add a new markdown file under the appropriate module directory (for example `Lessons/Module1/L1.6.md`).
4. Commit your changes and push the branch to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request describing the lesson and any review notes.
