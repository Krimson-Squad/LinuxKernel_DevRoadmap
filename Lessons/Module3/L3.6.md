# L3.6 — Rust error handling patterns for systems programming

Date: 2025-10-04

Author: Community Contributor (placeholder)

## Estimated time
30–45 minutes

## Objectives
- Introduce common error handling patterns in Rust useful for low-level systems code.
- Show examples using `Result`, `Option`, `thiserror`, and `anyhow`.
- Discuss trade-offs when writing code intended for kernel or low-level contexts.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Rust syntax and ownership (Module 3 content).

## Content
- Brief explanation of `Result<T, E>` and pattern matching.
- Using `?` for early returns and converting errors with `From`.
- When to prefer `thiserror` vs `anyhow` in libraries vs binaries.

## Exercises
- Rewrite a small function to return `Result` instead of panicking.
- Create a small enum of error types and implement `From` for conversions.

## Contributor notes
Placeholder lesson — expand with code snippets and references to `rust-lang` docs.
