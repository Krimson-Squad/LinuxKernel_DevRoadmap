# L3.7 — Unsafe Rust and FFI for low-level code

Date: 2025-10-04

Author: Community Contributor (placeholder)

## Estimated time
45–60 minutes

## Objectives
- Explain when `unsafe` is required and how to minimize unsafe blocks.
- Show common FFI patterns when interfacing Rust with C (useful in kernel or driver bindings).
- Provide safety-checklist for reviewing unsafe code.

## Content
- Primitives of `unsafe`: dereferencing raw pointers, calling `unsafe` functions, accessing mutable statics.
- Examples of wrapping unsafe code in safe abstractions.
- Using `bindgen` and `cc` crate for FFI integration.

## Exercises
- Convert a small piece of unsafe code into a safe wrapper.
- Use `bindgen` to generate Rust bindings for a simple C header.

## Contributor notes
Placeholder — expand with code examples and references.
