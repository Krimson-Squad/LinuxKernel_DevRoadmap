## Lesson 3.2: **Rust Memory Management**

Rust employs a unique memory management system that emphasizes safety and efficiency without the need for a garbage collector. Here are the key concepts:

### Ownership
- Every piece of data in Rust has a single owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the memory.

### Borrowing
- Rust allows references to data without transferring ownership through **borrowing**.
- Borrowing can be either mutable or immutable:
  - **Immutable Borrowing**: Multiple references can be created, but none can modify the data.
  - **Mutable Borrowing**: Only one mutable reference can exist at a time, preventing data races.

### Lifetimes
- Rust uses **lifetimes** to ensure that references are valid for as long as they are needed.
- Lifetimes help the compiler understand how long a reference should be considered valid, preventing dangling references.

### Benefits of Rust's Memory Management
- **Safety**: Eliminates common memory-related bugs like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.
- **Performance**: Achieves performance similar to C and C++ while maintaining safety.
- **No Runtime Overhead**: Memory management is handled at compile time, resulting in no additional runtime costs.
