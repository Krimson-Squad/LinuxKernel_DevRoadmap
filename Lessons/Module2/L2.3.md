Memory management is a crucial function of an operating system that handles the allocation, tracking, and management of a computer's memory resources. It ensures that applications have sufficient memory to execute while maintaining system stability and efficiency. 

Key aspects of memory management include:

- **Memory Allocation**: The process of assigning memory to various applications and services based on their requirements.
- **Paging and Segmentation**: Techniques that divide memory into manageable sections, allowing for efficient use and reducing fragmentation.
- **Virtual Memory**: A method that uses disk space to extend the apparent amount of memory available, enabling larger applications to run on systems with limited physical memory.
- **Garbage Collection**: The automatic reclamation of memory that is no longer in use, helping to prevent memory leaks and optimize performance.

Effective memory management helps in optimizing system performance, enhancing the user experience, and ensuring that applications run smoothly.
