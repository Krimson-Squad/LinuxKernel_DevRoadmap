The **basic components** of an **Operating System (OS)** work together to manage the computerâ€™s resources and provide a user interface. These components include:

- **Kernel**: The core of the OS that manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **File System**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and organization of files.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Provides a way for users to interact with the computer, either through a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** or **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.
- **Process Management**: Controls the execution of processes, ensuring proper resource allocation and scheduling.
- **Memory Management**: Keeps track of memory usage and optimizes the allocation of RAM to various processes.
- **Device Drivers**: Interface between hardware devices and the OS, allowing communication with peripherals like printers, keyboards, and disk drives.

These components work together to ensure that the OS functions efficiently and can meet the needs of users and applications.
