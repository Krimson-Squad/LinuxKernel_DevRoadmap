## Lesson 2.1: **Processes, Threads, and Scheduling**
[![Process States](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Process_states.svg/400px-Process_states.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_state)

Processes and threads are key components of modern operating systems. They enable multitasking and efficient CPU usage:

- **Processes**: A process is a program in execution, which includes the program code and its current activity. Each process operates in its own memory space and is managed by the operating system. 
- **Threads**: Threads are the smallest units of processing that can be scheduled by the operating system. A single process can have multiple threads that share the same memory space, allowing for more efficient execution.
- **Scheduling**: The operating system's scheduler manages the execution of processes and threads, allocating CPU time and optimizing performance. Scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed, impacting overall system responsiveness and efficiency.

Understanding these concepts is essential for grasping how modern operating systems function and manage resources effectively.
