### Lesson 10.2: Writing Kernel Modules in Rust
Explore creating kernel modules in Rust and understand how it differs from C:
   - **Rust Kernel Module Structure:** Basics of module structure, setup, and teardown functions in Rust.
   - **Interop with C:** How Rust interacts with C components in the kernel.
   - **Module Compilation and Testing:** Building and testing Rust kernel modules.

   Youâ€™ll complete this lesson with an understanding of writing Rust modules for the kernel.
