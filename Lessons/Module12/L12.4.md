# L12.4 — Kernel Hardening Techniques

Date: 2025-10-04

Author: Community Contributor (placeholder)

## Estimated time
45–90 minutes

## Objectives
- Introduce practical kernel hardening techniques used to reduce attack surface.
- Explain kernel configuration options and runtime mitigations.
- Provide references for further reading and tools.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of kernel internals and common vulnerabilities (Module 12 earlier lessons).

## Content
1. Kernel configuration options to enable hardening (e.g., KASLR, module signature enforcement, CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM).
2. Runtime mitigations: SMEP/SMAP, ASLR, stack canaries, GCC hardening flags (`-fstack-protector-strong`).
3. Using kernel lockdown mode and LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) to restrict access.
4. Minimizing attack surface: disabling unnecessary modules, careful device driver review.

## Exercises
- Audit a small kernel config and list three hardening options to enable and why.
- Research how KASLR works and its limitations.

## Further reading
- Kernel documentation on hardening and secure boot
- Papers on kernel attack surface reduction

## Contributor notes
Create more concrete examples and config snippets as follow-ups.
