### Lesson 12.2: Implementing Kernel Security Features
This lesson focuses on security features that help protect the kernel:
   - **Access Control Mechanisms:** Techniques like SELinux and AppArmor for controlled access.
   - **Security Modules:** Using the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework for custom security policies.
   - **Hardening the Kernel:** Configuration options to reduce the attack surface and enhance security.

   By the end, youâ€™ll be equipped to implement and configure key kernel security features.
