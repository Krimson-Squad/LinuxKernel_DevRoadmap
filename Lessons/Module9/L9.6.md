Date: 2025-10-31

Author: Community Contributor (placeholder)

## Estimated time
45–90 minutes

## Objectives
- Introduce kernel networking stack concepts: sockets, sk_buff, netdevice.
- Explain packet path: from driver to network stack to user-space.
- Point to tools and code paths to explore networking code.

## Content
- Overview of `net/` and `net/ipv4` subsystems.
- sk_buff structure and memory handling.
- Hooks for protocol handlers and netfilter.

## Exercises
- Trace the path of a TCP packet in a simple scenario using ctags or IDE navigation.
- Find the driver hook where packets are handed to the kernel network stack.

## Further reading
- Kernel networking documentation (Documentation/networking)
- netdev, netfilter tutorials

## Contributor notes
Placeholder; expand with code examples and quick grep commands.
