### Lesson 9.3: Writing Device Drivers
A deep dive into creating device drivers to interface with hardware:
   - **Driver Structure:** Key components of a driver, including initialization, cleanup, and device-specific functions.
   - **Device File Management:** Managing file descriptors, device nodes, and communication with user space.
   - **Testing Drivers:** Testing strategies for drivers, including emulating hardware when needed.

   This lesson prepares you to write and test drivers for a range of hardware devices.
