### Lesson 9.4: Kernel and Hardware Interaction
An exploration of how the kernel interfaces with hardware:
   - **Interrupt Handling:** Configuring and managing hardware interrupts in the kernel.
   - **Memory Management:** How the kernel manages hardware memory and the basics of DMA (Direct Memory Access).
   - **Hardware Abstraction:** Using kernel APIs for standardized access to hardware.

   By the end, youâ€™ll understand how the kernel communicates with hardware and manages resources.
